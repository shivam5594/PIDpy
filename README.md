# PIDpy

Tools to learn and visualize PID controller. Working on this tool to learn about PID and learn how to tune it looking at the graph.

## Goals:
1. Plot graphs for Ki, Kp and Kd
2. Plot graph of error and output
3. User input to set target through terminal OR UI
4. Add test cases for unit testing

## Future goals:
1. Read data from a robot or hardware through serial COM port
2. Plot live Kp, Ki, Kd, error and output data
